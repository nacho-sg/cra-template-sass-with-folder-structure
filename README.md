# cra-sass-with-folder-structure
This template tries to help with the organization of a medium-large application, adding support for sass and encouraging developers to follow an order way to apply the styles.
It already includes a jsconfig file with an absolute path pointing to src/ and a i18n folder so you could separate the labels from the jsx code.
