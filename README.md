# cra-sass-with-folder-structure
## Description
This template tries to help with the organization of a medium-large application, adding support for sass and encouraging developers to follow an order way to apply the styles.
It already includes a jsconfig file with an absolute path pointing to src/ and a i18n folder so you could separate the labels from the jsx code.

## How to use this template?
If you're going to create a new SPA, you could run the following command
```
npx create-react-app [your-app-name] --template sass-with-folder-structure
```
